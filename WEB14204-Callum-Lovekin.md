### Change By Design

We were put into teams with a handful of photography students and given the brief "Rebrand Imperial Leather" We chose as a group to change everything about the brand, from the target audience all the way to the packaging of their products. It was an immensely fun project which pushed my skills and my ability top work with others.

We researched and looked into other soap brands and how they advertise themselves to identify a gap in the market, we found a gap and started straight away on producing content for the project.
